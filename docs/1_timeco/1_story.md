March 15

06:00 hours Security Zone 7.

The historical tactical Center, an elite combat training facility home to the military's most powerful supercomputer. The Otaga Corporation has engineered a radical breakthrough in tachon physics that enables scientists literally to manipulate time for the military this means the power to simul at any form of combat past present or future. It also means the constant threat of electronic theft and sabotage. That's why the military created S.A.V.E. special action for virus elimination.

06:30 save agent Stanley opar starts his shift. It looks like an easy day, not even a routine drill. Until disaster strikes.

07:00 an agent for a rival Corporation has infiltrated the top ranks of Otaga programmers his mission sabotage. He infects the system with a specially designed Predator virus with no regard for its lethal consequences. Lodging itself in the computer's memory the virus creates a Time Distortion Vortex that will swallow everything in its path.

A class one alarm reserved for the highest level emergencies. He doesn't know it yet but this is no ordinary virus. Stanley opar is about to face The Ultimate Showdown. He must enter the vortex and save the computer from the rapidly mutating virus.

## Game Goals

Your mission is to destroy the virus that has invaded the HISTORICAL TACTICAL CENTER's central computer system. The game leads you through 8 of history's grandest epochs to arrive at the 9th level where the virus is located. To do this, as you travel through time you must capture as many non-infected memory circuits (represented by blue chips) as possible. This way, you will send all the healthy memory circuits back to the main computer each time you reach the memory upload terminals.

But watch out! Time is against you, and the virus is progressively attacking the main computer's memory. When the memory is completely contaminated by the virus, the game's over. Your work will be slowed down considerably by the horde of virtual enemies deployed by the virus. You must combat and eliminate all these enemies as quickly as possible.

## Game Screen Descriptions

### Player Energy (upper left corner)
{: .no_toc }
Your energy level is shown by more or less filled "batteries" The maximum number of batteries is 4, and each time you get hit, your energy drops. When you reach 0 "battery", you're dead.

### Extra Lives
{: .no_toc }
The maximum number of extra lives is 3. Each time you die (meaning you have no more energy or that the virus has completely contaminated the computer's memory), you can continue to play the current game if you have an "extra life." In this case, your energy is recharged to the maximum level (but in no case will it be more than the number of batteries). During the few seconds of flashing, you will be immortal.

### Enemy's Energy (upper right corner)
{: .no_toc }
Each time you are confronted by an enemy, his "life bar" will be displayed. When it reaches 0, he's dead.

### Infected Memory Stock (upper center)
{: .no_toc }
During the game, the virus progressively infects the memory of the HTC computer. This bar indicates its progress. A few minutes before it is full, you'll hear a steady "beep" that grows louder. When the memory is completely contaminated, you're dead.

### Non-infected Memory Stock (lower right corner)
{: .no_toc }
Throughout the game, you must collect as many non-infected memory circuits as possible. These must be put in the memory upload terminals in order to stop the virus' progression.

### List of Available Weapons
{: .no_toc }
Each level disposes of weapons from that time period. You will find them by destroying an enemy, picking them up off the ground, or searching for them in certain places. Each time, they are stockpiled in your weapon inventory boxes. Additional information may be displayed above or below them, depending on the characteristics of each weapon. For each arm that requires ammunition, the total amount of ammunition available is displayed above it. For a weapon with a charger, small white bars indicate the weapon charger's capacity and the total quantity of ammunition available. If the charger is empty, but you still have ammunition for the weapon, you have to reload .

### Weapom Selected
{: .no_toc }
A yellow frame and a brighter display indicate the weapon you have in hand.

### Ammunition in the Weapon Charger
{: .no_toc }
If your weapon has a charger, the ammunition available in the charger is displayed on the side of the screen.

## Bonus Descriptions

### Healthy memory (blue chips)
{: .no_toc }
Memory circuits non-infected by the virus. Pick up as many of them as possible.

### Memory upload terminal (plasmatic demi-sphere)
{: .no_toc }
Each time you near a memory upload terminal, place yourself in front of it and use the Action key [SPACE BAR]. All the healthy memory circuits you have collected will then be sent back to the main computer to hold off the virus' progression. Each time you upload your memory, the game you're playing is saved. (You can make one save per memory upload terminal and per player at the difficulty level chosen).

### Life points (yellow cubes)
{: .no_toc }
When you step on a yellow cube, you win back a little energy. But the power you gain is limited by your current number of energy stockpile batteries (1 to 4).

### Life Points (red cube)
{: .no_toc }
When you step on a red cube, you gain the equivalent of one battery's worth of life points. Once again, the power gained is limited by the number of energy stockpile you have left.

### Energy stockpile battery (yellow battery)
{: .no_toc }
Each battery you acquire is added to your energy stockpile capacity (points of life) until the maximum number of "batteries" (4) is reached. Your current energy level will go back up to the maximum level each time you pick up a new battery.

### Extra life
{: .no_toc }
The game is over when your energy level reaches zero, or when the virus has contaminated all of the HTC computer's memory. However, if you have an extra life, you've got another chance... You will reappear, flashing on and off, at the spot where you died. As long as the flashing continues, you are immortal. When you use an extra life, part of the infected memory is restored and your current energy goes back up to maximum; however you lose one of your stockpile batteries (if you had more than one).
